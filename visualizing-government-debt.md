## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

**Visualization 1: Government Debt Bar Chart**

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

General Government Debt for 2021

## Part 2: Working with Flourish

**Visualization 2: Grid of Line Charts**

The visualization displays a grid of line charts showcasing the government debt of various nations from 1995 to 2021. The grid contains several mini line charts, one for each country, showing the evolution of the Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021 for each nation.

**Visualization 3: The third data visualization**

This visualization presents the Government Debt-to-GDP ratio for all European countries with special focus on how Italy and Greece's Debt-to-GDP varies from 1995 to 2021. I would like to investigate how Italy and Greece evolves to the top leading countries that bear high government debt-to-GDP ratio given the background of overall European countries' trend.

## Conclusion
**Bar Chart:** It focuses on the data of 2021 and arrange countries in ascending order of the Debt-to-GDP ratio. People can clearly see which government has the largest ratio and select each bar to check detailed information. Japan, Greece, and Italy are the Top 3 leading country that has high debt-to-GDP ratio.

**Grid of Line Charts:** With the same x-scale and y-scale for each chart, it presents a comprehensive overview of the data and it makes easy to trace the debt-to-GDP ratio trend for each country. However, it is challenging to make comparison on data across countries. From the grid, we can see that Japan is the country with the highest growth rate of debt-to-GDP ratio over the past few years whereas Estonia's ratio stays low and stable. Moreover, as an interactive visualization, audience can hover over the lines to see the desired year's Debt-to-GDP ratio for a country.

**Line Charts:** I choose to use line chart to investigate the overall debt-to-GDP ratio trend in Europe because it shows the changes over time. Line chart can compare multiple variables simultaneously so that I can extract relevant information among countries. From the above visualization, we found Greece and Italy's ratio starts off high since 1995 and they both drastically increase from 2011-2013.
