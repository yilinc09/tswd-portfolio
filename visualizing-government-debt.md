## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

**Visualization 1: Government Debt Bar Chart**

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

**Visualization 2: Grid of Line Charts**

The visualization displays a grid of line charts showcasing the government debt of various nations from 1995 to 2021. The grid contains several mini line charts, one for each country, showing the evolution of the Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021 for each nation.

**Visualization 3: The third data visualization**
I choose to use line chart to presents the trend of debt-to-GDP ratio for all countries.


## Conclusion
**Bar Chart:** It focuses on the data of 2021 and arrange countries in ascending order of the Debt-to-GDP ratio. People can clearly see which government has the largest ratio and select each bar to check detailed information. Japan, Greece, and Italy are the Top 3 leading country that has high debt-to-GDP ratio.

**Grid of Line Charts:** It is easy to trace the debt-to-GDP ratio trend for each country from 1995 to 2021 but it is difficult to make comparison on the ratio value among countries. From the grid, we can see that Japan is the country with the highest growth rate of debt-to-GDP ratio over the past few years whereas Estonia's ratio stays low and stable.
