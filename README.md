# tswd-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU.

# About me
Hi! I am Yilin. I am studying master of information system management in CMU.
Under the About me section, write a couple paragraphs about yourself!  You can include things like your name, pronouns, the program you're in, or other insights you'd like to share with the class (and more broadly, perhaps future employers!).  You don't have to include any personal information here that you would prefer keeping off of a public website (see the note below). 

# What I hope to learn
talk about what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.
