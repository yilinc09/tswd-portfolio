## How COVID-19 has changed consumer spending habits

#### Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy, causing widespread job losses, business closures, and declining consumer spending. The pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to supply chains, reduced consumer confidence, and led to widespread economic uncertainty. As a result of these factors, consumers have changed their spending habits, becoming more cautious and focusing on necessities rather than luxury items. This shift in spending has had a profound impact on many industries, including retail, hospitality, and tourism, and has led to significant changes in the way that businesses operate and the products and services they offer. These changes will likely have long-lasting effects on the global economy and the way that consumers spend their money in the future.

The primary audience of this project is the master's students at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. Through this project, I wish to highlight how consumer spending habits has changed in COVID-19, primarily focusing on the shifts that have occurred in 2022.

#### Project Structure
- Background: GDP declines (2020), unemployment rate rises
- 
- Shift to online shopping: With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, many consumers have turned to online shopping for their necessities, leading to a surge in e-commerce activity.
- Increase in spending on necessities: Consumers have been spending more on necessities such as groceries, household supplies, and health-related products, as they spend more time at home and take precautions against the virus.
- Decline in spending on discretionary items: With widespread economic uncertainty and job loss, consumers have cut back on spending on discretionary items such as dining out, travel, and entertainment.
- Rise in savings and debt reduction: Some consumers have taken advantage of the pandemic to save more money, reduce debt, and focus on financial stability.
- Changes in spending patterns: The pandemic has also caused changes in the timing and frequency of consumer spending, as well as shifts in spending priorities and preferences.



The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  Your outline should be something that you can later use to help fill in some of the details around your project.  

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.  
- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 


## Initial sketches
We've begun to explore how sketching can be a great way to help solidify your ideas into design choices, and for your proposal you'll be creating sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project.  You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion you feel makes the most sense - but they should be clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic and follow aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate, but they should be detailed enough so that we can get some sense of what you're planning on doing. You may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.).   Show both your anticipated data visualizations as well as major elements of your story itself (e.g key headers, etc.)

## The data
It's important that you identify your primary data sources.  To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
- A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 


## Method and medium

To finish the final project, I plan to build up the story presented in the previous section using Shorthand by integrating relevant data visualizations and images. The visualizations will mainly be developed using Flourish, with the possibility of using Tableau if it proves to be a more appropriate tool for some of the visualizations. I will also search for appealing images on Unsplash to enhance the narrative and make it more impactful.
