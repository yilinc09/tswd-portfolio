# The final data story

**Food Behavior in Chinese Households during Covid-19: Did Age Matter?** - [Link to Shorthand Storyboard](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/food-behavior-in-chinese-households-during-covid-19-did-age-matter/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II 

## Final design decisions

**Topics**

My initial topic was about _How COVID-19 has changed consumer spending habits_, but I figured this topic might be too broad based on the feedback I got from my peers and professor. Due to the multitude of spending categories, such as clothing, food, cosmetics, and transportation, I was overwhelmed by the amount of articles and data sources during my online research on consumer spending. As a result, I decided to change the topic of my final deliverable from Part II of the project, narrowing it down to changes in food behavior within the Chinese population. Additionally, I chose to explore how various age groups have altered their behavior in this regard.

**Visualization**

After conducting interviews with my classmates, I became aware that the visualization contained too many colors, resulting in an inconsistent color scheme throughout the entire data story. Consequently, I modified the visualization to maintain a consistent color scheme when comparing food behavior across different age groups. Each food behavior analysis topic has one graph that uses the same visualization template, namely the grouped column chart. This method ensures that each age group is consistently represented by a single color in the bar chart across various aspects of food behavior analysis. As a result, it simplifies the audience's interpretation of the data for each age group by eliminating the need to frequently refer to the legend for each visualization.

**Text**

I emphasized significant terms by using bold text to capture the audience's attention immediately upon first glance.

**Call to Action**

Part II of my project lacked a proper conclusion or call to action, as it only presented the background, research, facts, and findings. However, in my final update, I incorporated one more slide to provide conclusions on my findings. I urged my target audience to develop the food supply chain in China with a focus on older people since they bear the greatest responsibility for procuring food for their families. I also suggested establishing innovative food sourcing platforms for the younger generations, as they tend to adapt more readily to change.

## The audience

Originally, I wanted to target all of the classmates who are taking this course as well as the professor. Therefore, my original topic investigated the change in consumer spending behaviors for many categories such that to touch on everyone's interest. However, after I narrowed down my topic specifically on food category and its difference among different age group, then my target audience will include researchers or academics in the fields of public health, nutrition, and sociology who are interested in studying the impact of COVID-19 on food behavior in Chinese households. It could also be relevant to policymakers or organizations involved in food supply chains or public health initiatives in China. My final call to action will help them focus on online shopping platform regulations and to target the appropriate consumer groups when introducing new products in Chinese food supply chain market.

# Final thoughts

Overall, I would say there is room for improvement in terms of the narration during the final presentation of this project. I created scripts ahead of time to accommodate the one-minute time restriction. It's crucial to choose the most crucial information to ensure that the audience can follow the main storyline effectively, given the abundance of information presented in the slides. Although I believe I did a good job selecting the essential content, I occasionally forgot what I was supposed to say during some of the slides, resulting in a few seconds of hesitation. However, since the script was tailored to fit the one-minute limit, I plan to rehearse more frequently and speak slightly faster if I have another opportunity to present.
