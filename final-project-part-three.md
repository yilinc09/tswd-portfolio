# The final data story

**Food Behavior in Chinese Households during Covid-19: Did Age Matter?** - [Link to Shorthand Storyboard](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/food-behavior-in-chinese-households-during-covid-19-did-age-matter/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II & Final design decisions

**Topics**

My initial topic was about _How COVID-19 has changed consumer spending habits_, but I figured this topic might be too broad based on the feedback I got from my peers and professor. Due to the multitude of spending categories, such as clothing, food, cosmetics, and transportation, I was overwhelmed by the amount of articles and data sources during my online research on consumer spending. As a result, I decided to change the topic of my final deliverable from Part II of the project, narrowing it down to changes in food behavior within the Chinese population. Additionally, I chose to explore how various age groups have altered their behavior in this regard.

**Visualization**

Based on the interview results I got from my classmates, I realized I utilized too many colors 

**Call to Action**

Part II of my project lacked a proper conclusion or call to action, as it only presented the background, research, facts, and findings. However, in my final update, I incorporated one more slide to provide conclusions on my findings. I urged my target audience to develop the food supply chain in China with a focus on older people since they bear the greatest responsibility for procuring food for their families. I also suggested establishing innovative food sourcing platforms for the younger generations, as they tend to adapt more readily to change.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

Overall, I would say there is room for improvement in terms of the narration during the final presentation of this project. To account for the one-minute time limit, I prepared scripts in advance. Since the slides contain a lot of information, it's essential to select the most critical parts to ensure that the audience can follow the main logical flow of the story I aim to present. Perhaps due to a lack of practice, I occasionally forgot what I was supposed to say during some of the slides, resulting in a few seconds of hesitation. However, since the script is designed to work within the one-minute limit, I plan to practice more beforehand and speak a bit faster next time.
