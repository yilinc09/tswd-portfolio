# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience will be master students who are taking the course _Telling Stories with Data_ in CMU. Therefore, I conducted interviews with three individuals from different graduate programs and genders in order to maximize the sample variation.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Ensure effective communication | Do you find the presentation comprehensible and easy to follow? Is the logical flow clear to you? Do you feel interested and engaged with the content?|
| Enhance visual presentation | Do the color scheme and visualizations make sense and fit the project's theme appropriately? Do any modifications need to be made? |
| Obtain feedback for improvement | Do you have any recommendations for changes? Do you have any new ideas or suggestions to offer? |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Female, mid 20‘s) | Interview 2 (Male, mid 20’s) | Interview 3 (Female, mid 20's)|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you easily follow the logical flow of this presentation? | Yes, it looks very easy to follow  |  Yes  |  I understand how you illustrate the change of consumer behavior during COVID-19 and how the changes are differentiated between different age groups, but maybe you can think more thoroughly on how you can better end the story. |
| Are the color scheme and visualization suitable for this context to help you understand the content?  |   Too many colors are used. Maybe stick to one color scheme and make the less important information in gray  |  The title of each visualization is vague, a subtitle might be helpful in this case  |  Yes! I like how you choose the type of visualization, it helped me understand the project content |
| Any suggestions for improvements? |  Nothing else except the color scheme I referred earlier | Maybe more usage of visual aids and less texts would be beneficial | No, it looks good to me overall. |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Color scheme | My approach will be to adhere to a single color scheme, utilizing a contrast between dark and light colors to highlight the significance of the presented information. |
| Title | I'll add subtitles to each visualization to provide additional context or explanation for the displayed data or graph |
| More visualization and less text | I'll try to keep the text more concise and find more relevant visualizations  |
| Conclusion | I'll add a conclusion or possibly a call to action at the end of the presentation |
