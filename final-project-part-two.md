# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience will be master students who are taking the course _Telling Stories with Data_ in CMU. Therefore, I conducted interviews with three individuals from different graduate programs and genders in order to maximize the sample variation.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Ensure effective communication | Do you find the presentation comprehensible and easy to follow? Is the logical flow clear to you? Do you feel interested and engaged with the content?|
| Enhance visual presentation | Do the color scheme and visualizations make sense and fit the project's theme appropriately? Do any modifications need to be made? |
| Obtain feedback for improvement | Do you have any recommendations for changes? Do you have any new ideas or suggestions to offer? |
